# DATACAMP-PROJECT-1--TV-HALFTIME-SHOWS-AND-THE-BIG-GAME

## Introduction
Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. It's a show, baby. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:

What are the most extreme game outcomes? 

How does the game affect television viewership? 

How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time? 

Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

## Conclusion
So most non-band musicians do 1-3 songs per halftime show. It's important to note that the duration of the halftime show is fixed (roughly 12 minutes) so songs per performance is more a measure of how many hit songs you have. JT went off in 2018, wow. 11 songs! Diana Ross comes in second with 10 in her medley in 1996.

In this notebook, I have loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. I have visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. I have used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. And I discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.
